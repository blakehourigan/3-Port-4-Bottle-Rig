## Spout to Delivery Frame Mounts 

This directory contains the files used on the mounts on which teflon delivery Spouts are mounted. Subdirectories include 
the larger 2-spout mount used for the center port, the single spout lateral (edge) mounts, and the mounting assembly used
for each of these mount to attach the teflon tube to the mounts. 

For each of these directories, follow the below steps to print all the components 
you will need for one rig:

- open the .3mf file named 'ALL {specific directory} Components' in PrusaSlicer.
- all settings will be set as needed, no need to modify unless these parts are found to be too weak. If so, infill percentage can be increased.  
- click 'Slice Now' in the bottom right of the PrusaSlicer window.
- remove the usb from the front of the Prusa Core One 3D printer. 
- plug the USB into your computer and wait for the USB icon to appear in the bottom right of the PrusaSlicer window. 
- click the USB icon and then click save in the popup window that appears. 
- re-insert the USB into the printer and click print when the print preview appears.
- wait until your print is complete.

All other stl files are the individual components that make up the 3mf file and are useful if only one replacement part is needed.

In this case the above steps will be very similar. The major difference is that you will open PrusaSlicer to a blank file (shown by '*Untitled' in the top left of the window and an empty print bed). You can then import your stl file by clicking 'File' in the left hand
corner of the window, then import, then stl/3mf/... You can then orient your part as you see fit, change settings, slice, and print!
