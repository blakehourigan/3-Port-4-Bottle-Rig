## Delivery Frame Motor & Idler Components

This directory contains the files used for the motion system in the 3 port rig. These components connect the Delivery
Frame Z-axis posts and the 10x100mm rods to the X-axis rods, as well as mounts the motor and idler to the 
frame to allow for center port motion.

To print all the components you will need for one rig:

- open the .3mf file named 'ALL Delivery Frame Motor & Idler Components' in PrusaSlicer.
- all settings will be set as needed, no need to modify unless these parts are found to be too weak. If so, infill percentage can be increased.  
- click 'Slice Now' in the bottom right of the PrusaSlicer window.
- remove the usb from the front of the Prusa Core One 3D printer. 
- plug the USB into your computer and wait for the USB icon to appear in the bottom right of the PrusaSlicer window. 
- click the USB icon and then click save in the popup window that appears. 
- re-insert the USB into the printer and click print when the print preview appears.
- wait until your print is complete.

All other stl files are the individual components that make up the 3mf file and are useful if only one replacement part is needed.

In this case the above steps will be very similar. The major difference is that you will open PrusaSlicer to a blank file (shown by '*Untitled' in the top left of the window and an empty print bed). You can then import your stl file by clicking 'File' in the left hand
corner of the window, then import, then stl/3mf/... You can then orient your part as you see fit, change settings, slice, and print!
