## Cage Alignment Components

This directory contains the models used to align and lock the cage in position along the edges of the cage. 

The small components are used at the front of the cage nearest to the delivery components, while the large are used everywhere else.

To print all the components you will need for one box:

- open the .3mf file named 'ALL Cage Alignment Components' in PrusaSlicer.
- all settings will be set as needed, no need to modify unless these are found to be too weak. If so, infill percentage can be increased. 
- remove the usb from the front of the Prusa Core One 3D printer. 
- plug the USB into your computer and wait for the USB icon to appear in the bottom right of the PrusaSlicer window. 
- click the USB icon and then click save in the popup window that appears. 
- re-insert the USB into the printer and click print when the print preview appears.
- wait until your print is complete.
