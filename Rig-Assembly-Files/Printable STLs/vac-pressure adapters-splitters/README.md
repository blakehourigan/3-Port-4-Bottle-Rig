## Vacuum Pressure Adapters & Splitters

This directory contains the vacuum splitter objects I made for use in the pressure and
vac systems on the 3-port rig. Import these stl files into prusa slicer and edit 
the settings to your liking (usually 100% infill for air tight prints) and upload to 
Prusa USB to print.
