## Top Components

Here you will find all components related to the rig box top. This includes:

- The actual cage top model. This is the piece that is machined. Useful if modifications
to the CNC top need to be made. 

- Top handle, the handle the is secured with screws to the cage top. 

- Pivot Mounts. These are the circular mounts that are screwed into the legs. This 
is the component on which the latch components that lock the top down mount. 

- Keepers. These are the rectangular components that mount to each edge of the top 
for the latches to grab onto. Careful attention must be paid to the location where 
these keepers should mount on the top, because the latch location for the front and rear of the
top is **NOT** the same.
